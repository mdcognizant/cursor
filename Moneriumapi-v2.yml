  title: Monerium API
  description: |
    API for developers to integrate Monerium payments, wallets, and user onboarding functionalities into their applications.

    We have created new, more intuitive version 2 endpoints.
    We are not introducing backward-breaking changes to the version 1 of the Monerium API.

    <p style="background: rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.1); padding: 30px;">
      Version 2 is in beta, you may notice changes before the final release.<br />We recommend using this version now, as it will soon become a stable release.
    </p>

    <p style="background: rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.1); padding: 30px;">
        Endpoints or responses that have not been implemented are marked with <b>WIP</b> (Work In Progress).

      summary: Authorization
      description: |
        Users must grant your application authorization to access their data.

        This endpoint issues a Temporary Redirect (HTTP 307) to the [Authorization Code Flow](/docs/getting-started/auth-flow) where users can sign up, onboard, connect their wallets and authorize your app to access to their data.

        Use the `Authorization Code Flow client_id` and the other parameters below to redirect users to the Monerium onboarding screen.

        Upon authorization, users will be redirected back to your application `redirect_uri` with an authorization `code` in the query parameters.

        Alternatively a "Sign in with Ethereum" (SIWE) flow can be used for existing Monerium customers. In this case the payload must include a valid
        [EIP-4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) message and signature. On successful authorization the authorization code is returned at once.

        This authorization code is then used to request an access token via the [token endpoint](/api-docs#operation/auth-token).

        Note that the context is used for every authenticated request. By default results are returned by the caller profile.

        Create a user and profile by submitting the user's email address
        that your platform has validated. The user can also use the email address
        to generate a password and authenticate to the monerium app.
        The Monerium API will return a profile UUID that you will use to submit
        all of the customer's details.

        Your app will be automatically authorized to access the user data.

      description: |
        API users can authenticate themselves by providing an [OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) access token.

        You get two types of `client_id` when you register your app:

        ![client IDs](/assets/client_ids.png)

        NOTE: You must use the correct `client_id` when picking the authorization flow.
        You get the following error when you are using the wrong client_id for the grant_type:

        ```json
        {
          "code": 400,
          "status": "Bad Request",
          "message": "The client is not authorized to request a token using this method."
        }
        ```

        **Authorization Code Flow and refresh token**

        For mobile and web apps that cannot securely store a client secret without exposing it to the users.

        Your application acquires an authorization `code` through the [PKCE authorization flow](/docs/api#auth-code).
        you can use this authorization code to obtain an `access_token` and a `refresh_token` using `grant_type=authorization_code`.

        The access token can then be used to authenticate all requests for the following hour, after which the token must be refreshed using the `refresh_token` with `grant_type=refresh_token`.

        **Client Credentials Authorization**

        Client credentials can be used when application is acting on its own behalf. When performing requests on behalf of the user, the authorization code flow should be used instead.
        While the client credentials give the application the possibility to access user data today, this will change in the future, and not all endpoints will be available for client credentials.

        Request an `access_token` by using the `client_id` and `client_secret` with `grant_type=client_credentials`.

        The access token can then be used to authenticate all requests for the following hour, after which you can get a new one.

        A blockchain address, often called a public key or wallet address, is a unique identifier within a blockchain that serves as a destination for sending, receiving, or storing digital assets, such as the EURe onchain fiat token.

        The customer's address is linked to Monerium to request an IBAN for it and perform cross-chain transactions. Linking the address requires a signature to prove that the customer owns the address.

        **Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)** can generate offchain 65 byte signatures with the user having control of the account via a private key managed by a software wallet like MetaMask or a hardware wallet like Ledger.

        **Smart Contract Accounts (SCAs) or Smart Accounts (SAs)**, are different from EOAs as they are smart contracts (code) immutably linked to the blockchain like the Safe wallet. Monerium supports [ERC-1271: Standard Signature Validation Method for Contracts](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271), which can be implemented in two ways.

        1. **Offchain**: The signatures are collected offchain and set in the "signature" field of the request. For multisig wallets, the signatures are concatenated in a 65 byte array.
        2. **Onchain**: The signatures are collected and validated onchain by the smart contract. The "signature" field in the request is set to "0x" and the Monerium infrastructure will verify the onchain with the connected SCA. The SCA emits an event `SignMsg(bytes32 indexed msgHash)` after signing that the Monerium infrastructure validates the signature and completes connecting the wallet.

            * This script demonstrates how to add addresses to a Monerium profile
            * and create signatures for EOA, Safe onchain transactions, and Safe offchain messages.
            *
            * Prerequisites:
            * 1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ (if not already installed).
            * 2. Create a folder for this project and navigate to it in your terminal.
            * 3. Create a file called `reqNewAddressV2.js` and paste this script into it.
            * 4. Install the required npm packages by running:
            *    npm install dotenv @monerium/sdk ethers @safe-global/protocol-kit @safe-global/safe-core-sdk-types @safe-global/api-kit axios
            * 5. Create a `.env` file in your project directory and add your environment variables:
            *    SAFE_ADDRESS=your_safe_address
            *    PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
            *    PRIVATE_KEY_2=your_second_private_key (if using Safe)
            *    INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
            *    ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
            *    PROFILE_ID=profile_that_owns_the_address
            *    CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
            *    CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
            * 6. Run the script using:
            *    node reqNewAddressV2.js [eoa|safe-onchain|safe-offchain]
            *
            * Note: Replace the placeholder values in the `.env` file with your actual values.
            * Tips
            *  Create a Safe on Sepolia and a Punk wallet (https://punkwallet.io/)
            *  Make the punk wallet a owner of the safe and use that private key

        An order represents an instruction to transfer funds from one account to another.
        The transfer can occur within the blockchain ecosystem (cross-chain) or from a blockchain account to a traditional bank account via SEPA.

        An order requires a signature from the wallet owner to authorize the processing of the order.
        The wallet owner signs a specific message to prove ownership and consent for the transaction.

        Attaching a supporting document for amounts above 15,000 EUR is required. Supporting document can be an invoice or an agreement.

            * This script demonstrates how to place an order with Monerium API
            * and create signatures for EOA, Safe onchain transactions, and Safe offchain messages.
            *
            * Prerequisites:
            * 1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ (if not already installed).
            * 2. Create a folder for this project and navigate to it in your terminal.
            * 3. Create a file called `reqNewAddress.js` and paste this script into it.
            * 4. Install the required npm packages by running:
            *    npm install dotenv @monerium/sdk ethers @safe-global/protocol-kit @safe-global/safe-core-sdk-types @safe-global/api-kit
            * 5. Create a `.env` file in your project directory and add your environment variables:
            *    SAFE_ADDRESS=your_safe_address
            *    PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
            *    PRIVATE_KEY_2=your_second_private_key (if using Safe)
            *    INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
            *    ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
            *    PROFILE_ID=profile_that_owns_the_address
            *    CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
            *    CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
            * 6. Run the script using:
            *    node reqNewAddress.js [eoa|safe-onchain|safe-offchain]
            *
            * Note: Replace the placeholder values in the `.env` file with your actual values.
            * Tips
            *  Create a Safe on Sepolia and a Punk wallet (https://punkwallet.io/)
            *  Make the punk wallet a owner of the safe and use that private key

        For Safe onchain signatures, your app needs to ensure that [the signature transaction is created](https://docs.safe.global/sdk/protocol-kit/guides/signatures/messages#on-chain-messages).

        Setting the signature to `0x` let's the Monerium API know that this is an onchain signature.

        The Monerium API supports [ERC-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) and will verify the signature using the wallet's `isValidSignature(messageHash, '0x')` method.

        The Safe wallet has a predefined threshold for the number of signatures required to authorize a transaction.
        For example, if the Safe wallet has 5 owners and a threshold of 3, at least 3 valid signatures are required to proceed with the transaction.

        The Monerium API will continue to verify if the signature has been confirmed for up to 5 days.

      Monerium offers a sandbox test environment for developers to integrate and test their applications:

        - **Sandbox API URL:** `https://api.monerium.dev`
        - **Sandbox web app:** `https://sandbox.monerium.dev`

        Before onboarding users via your application, you must [register your application](/docs/getting-started/create-app) with Monerium.

        When you are ready to go live, then you can register your application in our production environment:

        - **Production API URL:** `https://api.monerium.app`
        - **Production web app:** `https://monerium.app`

        To access the version 2 of the Monerium API, you may need to specify the Accept header in your requests.
        This header ensures that you are using the correct version of the API. See the endpoint documentation for details where this is required.
        The Accept header must have the value `application/vnd.monerium.api-v2+json`.
        Below are examples using curl and JavaScript (Fetch API).

        ```bash
          curl -X GET 'https://api.monerium.dev/profiles' \
            -H 'Accept: application/vnd.monerium.api-v2+json' \
            -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
        ```

        ```js
          fetch('https://api.monerium.dev/profiles', {
            method: 'GET',
            headers: {
              'Accept': 'application/vnd.monerium.api-v2+json',
              'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
            }
          })
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(data => console.log(data))
          .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
        ```

      ### Authentication context

      The difference between V1 and V2 API is how the endpoints handle the caller identity. In V2 most endpoints take the profile ID from the authentication context, meaning that when client credentials are used
      the requests are returning data for the application user profile. In order to fetch data for other authorized profiles the caller can set the profile UUID value in the request arguments.
      See specific endpoint documentation for details.

      ### Extra privileges

      Some endpoints are marked with the following label:

      <span style="display: inline-block;padding: 2px 8px;margin: 0px;background-color: rgb(44, 108, 167);color: rgb(255, 255, 255);vertical-align: middle;line-height: 1.6;border-radius: 4px;font-weight: 600;font-size: 12px;">
          Requires extra privileges
      </span>

      Access to these endpoints need to be granted to your app by the Monerium team.

      Monerium can offer applicable partners a KYC reliance or sharing agreement that can streamline the onboarding process for its customers.
      It is worth noting that Monerium is always ultimately responsible for conducting due diligence and monitoring the business relationship.

      - `webhook-signature`: HMAC signature of the webhook payload.

      The signature is computed using the following formula:

      ```
      envelope = webhook-id.webhook-timestamp.payload
      signature = base64Encode(HMAC-SHA256(envelope, secret))
      webhook-signature = v1,signature
      ```

      As an example, if the webhook ID is `3f3d820e-d01c-4c56-8be4-b20053225679`, the timestamp is `1745118540`, and the payload is:
      ```json
      {"type":"subscription.created","timestamp":"2024-08-09T12:44:04.777884Z"}
      ```
      then the signature sent in the `webhook-signature` header for a secret `whsec_mUt3nH+3wx/djdHf8RHn9yJMMiAhq10b` is: `v1,4gOAiajJT7ah++XpDFdRyK/TJ75whRjUcKOWnvsHNlk=`

      Please note that the payload  must be used exactly as it was received, without any modifications or formatting changes as any changes will result in a different signature.
